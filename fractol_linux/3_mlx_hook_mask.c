     * MLX_HOOK
     * Handle both left and right mouse button presses with the same function.
     * ðŸš¨If remove the mask, hook won't workðŸš¨
     *
     * TL;DR
     * In the X11 system (on which MiniLibX is based), events and event masks are two distinct things:

            Events (like ButtonPress): Describe the actual event type, such as pressing a button or moving the mouse.

            Event Masks (like ButtonPressMask): Are filters that determine which types of events a program wants 
            to listen for. By setting a specific mask, you're saying, "Notify me when this type of event happens."

        When you use mlx_hook(), specifying both the event and its corresponding mask ensures that you:
        Precisely define the event you're interested in (ButtonPress for a mouse button being pressed).
        Tell the X11 system that you want to be notified about this event by setting the appropriate filter (ButtonPressMask).

        ðŸ¤” Wait but why? ðŸ¤”
     * Event Mask (Filter 1): It's the first layer of filtering. When you set a mask, you're essentially telling the X11 system,
     *      "I'm interested in these types of events. Please notify me when they occur." 
     * Without the right mask set, the system won't even forward the event to your application.

       Event Name (Filter 2): Once the event gets through the mask and is delivered to your application, 
        you then have handler functions (like your button_press function) which handle specific event types 
        (like ButtonPress). This is where you react based on the exact event that occurred.

        In the context of mlx_hook(), you're setting up both layers of filtering. 
        ðŸ’¡ You specify the mask to ensure X11 sends the event to your program, 
        ðŸ’¡ and then your handler function responds based on the specific event name (every event has its how prototype)
