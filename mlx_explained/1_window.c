	 * The minilibx library has a function called mlx_loop. 
	 * This function starts what's known as an event loop. 
	 * An event loop keeps the application running and constantly 
	 * checks for events, such as user input (like mouse clicks or keyboard presses). 
	 * As long as the application is running, this loop continues to execute.

		while (application is running)
